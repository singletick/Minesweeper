## Minesweeper
Remember the old Minesweeper ?
This is a python script to implement and play minesweeper.

This is the same replica of the game completely playable. The whole game is to be played on command prompt.
You can completely customize the board size and number of mines.

If you open a cell having zero mines in its neighbours(all the 8 cells surrounding them), the game performs DFS-Depth First Search algorithm to automatically explore the surroundings.

To know the game rules you're just a "googlesearch" away!
Have fun!
